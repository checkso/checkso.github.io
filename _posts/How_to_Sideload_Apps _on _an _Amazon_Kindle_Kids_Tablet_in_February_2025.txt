### **Step 2: Install the App Launcher (Parent Profile)**

### **Step 4: Run ADB Commands (Child Profile)**  
1. **Switch to the Child Profile** on the tablet.  
2. On your computer, open a command prompt/terminal and run:  
   ```bash  
   adb shell  
   ```  
3. Execute these commands to enable critical Google services for YT Kids:  
   ```bash  
   cmd package install-existing com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids  
   cmd package install-existing com.google.android.gms  
   cmd package install-existing com.android.vending  
   cmd package install-existing com.google.android.gsf  
   cmd package install-existing com.google.android.gsf.login  
   ```

### **Step 5: Launch YouTube Kids (Child Profile)**  
1. On the tablet, open the **App Launcher** from the child profile‚Äôs app list.  
2. Select **YouTube Kids**‚Äîit should now launch without issues!

### **Why This Works**  
The ADB commands link Google Play Services (installed in the parent profile) to the child profile, while the App Launcher lets kids access approved apps. This method keeps the tablet secure while adding trusted content.  

**Pro Tip**: Reboot the tablet if YT Kids crashes initially. For stricter controls, use Amazon‚Äôs parental settings to limit screen time or block unintended apps.
